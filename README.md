# Hand-Gesture-Media-Controller

With the development in Computer Vision and Human Machine Interaction the
Computer holds most important role in our daily life. Human Computer Interaction
can provides several advantages with the introducing the different natural forms of
device free communication. Gesture recognition is one of the several types of them
to interact with the humans gestures are the natural form of action which we often
used in our day to day life. But in computer application to interact humans with
machine the interaction with devices like keyboard, mouse etc. must be requires.
As the various hand gestures are frequently used by humans so the aim of this
project is to reduce external hardware interaction which is required for computer
application, and hence this causes system more reliable for use with ease.
In this project, we have imported different libraries such as cv2, numpy, math,
pyautogui, time. And also implemented different types of sectors in our project
such as read camera, window name, detecting hand, etc. Basically our project is for
controlling of VLC media player using hand gesture.
